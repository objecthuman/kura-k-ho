# Kura-K-Ho

A news aggregation and analysis platform that helps you stay informed about current events in Nepal by gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information from multiple trusted news sources.

## What It Does

Kura-K-Ho searches across major Nepali news outlets to provide you with comprehensive, fact-based answers to your queries about current events. Instead of reading multiple articles from different sources, get a consolidated view that:

- **Aggregates Information**: Searches across Online Khabar, The Kathmandu Post, The Himalayan Times, Nepali Times, and The Annapurna Express
- **Analyzes Content**: Summarizes articles and extracts key facts from each source
- **Identifies Patterns**: Groups similar information when sources agree, and highlights contradictions when they don't
- **Provides Context**: Generates comprehensive answers with proper source attribution and links

## How It Works

1. Ask a question about a news event or current topic
2. The system searches for relevant articles across multiple news sources
3. Articles are analyzed and summarized
4. You receive a comprehensive answer that cites all sources with direct links

## Use Cases

- Stay informed about breaking news in Nepal
- Get multiple perspectives on current events
- Verify claims by checking what different sources report
- Save time by getting consolidated information instead of reading multiple articles
